> This website features the current version of the YWR Secretariat Handbook. See [the CHANGELOG]({% link CHANGELOG.md %}) for a list of changes and amendments.

The Secretariat handbook is intended to provide guidance to Lodge Secretaries and Chapter Scribe E's, whether new to Office or experienced administrators. While not intended to be exhaustive, it is hoped that this document will provide assistance with the majority of tasks expected of Secretaries and Scribe E's.

This site should be used as a Reference Manual, and will be updated from time to time as Rules and Provincial processes change. For this reason it is strongly recommended that all Secretaries and Scribe E's bookmark this page so that they can return to it later.

To use this document, please refer to the index on the left side of the page to find the subject you wish to view.

## Starter Guides

The essential documents that govern our Fraternity are:
- [The Book of Constitutions](https://www.ugle.org.uk/about-us/book-constitutions) - which applies to both Craft **and the Royal Arch where no Rule exists in the Regulations**
- [The Regulations of Supreme Grand Chapter](https://www.ugle.org.uk/about-us/royal-arch/supreme-grand-chapter) - which applies only to the Royal Arch
- [Information for the Guidance of Members of the Craft](https://www.ugle.org.uk/sites/default/files/media/file/information-guidance-members-craft-ugle.pdf) - which contains the decisions of the Board of General Purposes (the executive committee of Grand Lodge) which are binding on all Masons

This Handbook is intended to supplement and summarise these Rules for the convenience of Lodge Secretaries and Chapter Scribe E's. It is **not intended** to replace or overrule and should any contradiction be implied the above documents will always take precedent.

## Essential Rules
