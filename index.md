The Secretariat handbook is intended to provide guidance to Lodge Secretaries and Chapter Scribes E,
whether new to Office or experienced administrators. While not intended to be exhaustive, it is hoped
that this document will provide assistance with the majority of tasks expected of Secretaries and Scribes E.

This site should be used as a Reference Manual, and will be updated from time to time as Rules and
Provincial processes change. For this reason it is strongly recommended that all Secretaries and Scribes E
bookmark this page so that they can return to it later.

To use this document, please refer to the index on the left side of the page to find the subject you wish to view.

## Interpretation

Unless specifically stated, where in this document the word "Lodge" is used it should be interpreted to include
both Lodges and Chapters. This applies also to the Provincial Grand Lodge or Provincial Grand Chapter, and for
UGLE or SGC.

Similarly, unless specifically stated, where the word "Secretary" is used (including plural) it should be
interpreted to include both Secretary and Scribe E. This applies also to the Provincial Grand Secretary or
Provincial Grand Scribe E, and both the Deputies and Assistants.

## Starter Guides

This Handbook is intended to supplement and summarise the Rules contained below for the convenience of
Lodge Secretaries and Chapter Scribe E's. It is **not intended** to replace or overrule and should any
contradiction be implied the below documents will always take precedence.

The essential documents that govern Lodges and Chapters in Yorkshire, West Riding are:

### The Book of Constitutions

The Book of Constitutions, which includes the Craft Rules and the Royal Arch Regulations, are the governing
rules of Freemasonry in England.

Secretaries and Scribes E should endeavour to make themselves familiar with its contents, particularly those
rules which apply to private Lodges and Chapters.

A copy of the current Craft Rules may be downloaded [here](https://www.ugle.org.uk/about-us/book-constitutions).

The Royal Arch Regulations may be downloaded [here](https://www.ugle.org.uk/about-us/royal-arch/supreme-grand-chapter).

### Information for the Guidance of Members of the Craft

The recommendations and decisions of the Grand Lodge and of the Supreme Grand Chapter are published in the booklet
when adopted.

As they rules contained are edicts of Grand Lodge (Rule 229) and Supreme Grand Chapter (Rule 81) and therefore
carry the same authority as the Book of Constitutions.

It is available to download from the same link at the Craft Rules above.

### Provincial Bylaws of Yorkshire, West Riding

The Provincial Bylaws are available to download [here](https://www.westridingfreemasons.info/provincial-by-laws).
