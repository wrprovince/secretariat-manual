## Introduction
{: .no_toc }

It is the goal of the Provincial Secretariat to make the work of a Lodge Secretary straightforward and simple wherever possible. In order to achieve this goal, the Secretariat Toolbox provides a means to achieve most tasks for which a Secretary may need to contact the Province.

The following general principles apply to the Toolbox:
1. Access can be found on the Provincial Website (select "Secretariat Toolbox") or directly by selecting [here].
2. On opening the Form select "Lodge" or "Chapter" as appropriate.
3. Select your Lodge / Chapter from the drop down.
4. Select the task you wish to achieve and select "Submit".
5. You will then receive an email to the address which is on file for the Secretary containing a link to further complete the form.

{: .note }
The email address for the Secretary is updated based on that provided in your Installation Return. If this needs to be updated between Installations, please contact the Provincial Office.

The tasks that can be completed in the Toolbox are:

## Resignations

The new Provincial Resignation form has been updated to remove bottlenecks and reduce the workload put upon Secretaries upon the Resignation of a member. As such the new process for Resignations is as follows:
1. A Secretary receives a Resignation in writing from a member.
2. The Resignation is read in Open Lodge at the next Regular meeting (or is announced orally by the member in question).
3. The Secretary submits this form to inform the Secretariat about the Resignation.

This process is designed to reduce the work put on Secretaries by only requiring use of the form once, there is no need to return to the form unless the resignation is withdrawn. Following submission the form is still forwarded to the Liaison Officer in order that they may speak to the member in question.

{: .important }
Once a Secretary has submitted the Resignation form you must inform us as soon as possible if the member in question wishes to withdraw their resignation.

## Dispensations

There have been many questions to the Provincial Office regarding dispensations in recent years. Dispensations are only permitted in those circumstances allowed by the Book of Constitutions. In all other cases a Dispensation cannot be issued and the Rules and Regulations MUST be followed.

To assist, the Dispensation form has been updated to make it clear what is allowed with regards to Dispensations, including:
1. Altering the Date or Place of a Regular Meeting (Rules 139 & 142, Regulation 58)
2. Holding an Emergency Meeting (Rule 140)
3. Allowing the Election as Master/Principal of a Member not otherwise qualified (Rule 109, Regulations 49 & 50)
4. Allowing the election of a substitute Treasurer in the long term absence of the Treasurer (Rule 112 / Regulation 57)
5. To continue in office as Master or Principal for more than two years (Rule 115 / Regulation 51)
6. To be First Principal of more than one Chapter at the same time (Regulation 52 - Chapters only)
7. To temporarily change the place of all future meetings (Rule 141)

{: .note }
Please note that a dispensation is not required to move the date of a Regular Meeting ONLY if the date would otherwise fall on a prohibited day (Christmas Day / Good Friday) or a Bank Holiday. In such a case the date may be changed by up to 7 days forwards or back. For more than 7 days a Dispensation is still required, and in all cases the date may not be changed by more than 28 days.

The following Dispensations can only be given by the Grand Master (or First Grand Principal):
1. To be Master of more than one Lodge at the same time (Rule 115)
2. To meet on a Sunday (Rule 139)
3. To confer Degrees at a less interval than 4 weeks (Rule 172 - Lodges only)

{: .warning }
> Dispensations cannot be considered where the Book of Constitutions does not permit, and this includes:
> - Allowing someone to hold more than 1 Regular Office
> - To exalt someone into Royal Arch fewer than 4 weeks after being Raised
>
> All requests for Dispensations for the above, and any other cause not premitted by the Rule and Regulations will be declined.

## Submit Form P

This form provides Secretaries the ability to submit a completed Form P to the Provincial Office for processing. Forms should only submitted following Initiation (or Exaltation in Chapter) or after a joining / rejoining member has taken up their membership.

## Change Contact Details

{: .highlight }
Did you know that members can update their contact details with UGLE using Portal? If a member has not signed up they can access this service [here](https://desktop.portal.ugle.org.uk/).

This Form should be used by Secretaries to regularly inform the Province of any changes to the contact details of their members and can be used to submit multiple updates. It is important that updates are communicated in a timely manner as the details provided by Secretaries are used to send invitations to Annual Meetings of Provincial Grand Lodge, Annual Convocations of Provincial Grand Chapter, and also any communications regarding Provincial Honours.

## Honourary Members

Where a Lodge has elected a new Honourary member this form should be used to inform the Province following a successful ballot.

## Exclusion

When a member has been excluded under Rule 181 the Province should be informed following the ballot using this form. The form can be used to submit multiple members, but only those excluded at the same meeting and for the same cause.

## Cessation

Under Rule 148 / Regulation 71, when a member is in default of their subscriptions for two calendar years their member automatically ceases. In such cases the Province must be informed including the total amount of their arrears.

## Death Notice

Where a member has died the Province must be informed using this form.

## Arrears

Where a former member not in good standing pays some or all of their outstanding arrears please use this form to inform the Province.

## Passing / Raising (Lodges Only)

When a Brother has been Passed & Raised, please use this form, attaching a completed LP&A5, to inform the Province so that a Grand Lodge certificate can be requested. The form may only be submitted after the member has been Raised and not before.

{: .important}
If a member resigns following their Passing but before their Raising please contact the Provincial Office so that the Passing may be recorded.
