## General

The Summons is the Meeting Notice given to all members for every meeting of every Lodge and Chapter
and includes the agenda as well as other crucial details.

As Secretary, you are responsible for preparing and distributing the Summons. It is important that
they are accurate and follow the rules, as this can impact the business of your Lodge if not followed correctly.

{: .important }
The Summons for any meeting must be issued not less than **TEN DAYS** prior the meeting. This is not a target
and the Provincial Office encourages Lodges to issue Summonses as early as possible after their previous meeting.

When issued, the Summons must be sent all members and to any such other persons as the Province should from
time to time direct. They should additionally be sent to the Provincial Office at
'summonsA\#@wrprovince.com' (where '\#' is your Area number).

If the presence of the Provincial Grand Master or his Deputy is desired at any special meeting of the Lodge,
initial contact should be via the Provincial Grand Secretary with a minimum of twelve months notice.

It should also be noted that, by virtue of their Office, the Provincial Grand Master, his Deputy, and Assistants,
can demand admission into any Lodge in the Province and therefore do not need 'invitations' to attend any meeting.
The same applies to the Grand Superintendent, his Deputy and Co-Principals in the Royal Arch,
but not to the Assistants to the Provincial Grand Principals.

The Provincial Grand Secretary must be informed in advance if a Ruler from another Province is to visit a Lodge
in Yorkshire, West Riding.

## Abbreviations and Titles

A Brother is entitled to use 'Worshipful Brother' immediately after he has been installed as Master of a Lodge.
A Companion is entitled to use 'Excellent Companion' immediately after being installed as Third Principal of a Chapter.

The correct abbreviation for an Acting Officer of Grand Lodge is for example 'SGD' for
Senior Grand Deacon, or for Past Rank 'PSGD'.

The correct abbreviation for an acting Provincial Officer is 'Prov' (e.g. 'ProvSGW') and for a
Past Provincial Officer 'PProvSGW'. It is the rule of Grand Lodge that 'P' only applies to 'past' and
therefore the use of 'PP' (e.g. 'PPSGW') should not be used to avoid confusion with Grand Rank.
Neither should spaces or full stops be used between any of the letters or abbreviations
(i.e. 'PProvSGW' not 'PProv SGW' or 'P.Prov.S.G.W')

## Past Masters

On every Summons issued the names and Ranks of every Past Master that appears in the Grand Lodge Installation Return
must be included, along with his office or rank (if any) in the Grand Lodge, in the Provincial Grand Lodge, the number
of Lodge and the year in which he was installed as Master.

## Lists of Officers

Where Officers are listed on the Summons they should be listed per the precedence defined in Rule 104(d)
Book of Constitutions. The IPM is not an Officer, but may be named elsewhere on the Summons as such,
or in the list of Officers either immediately after the Master or Junior Warden. Regulation 48 in the
Royal Arch defines the precedence of Chapter Officers, and similarly the IPZ, while not an Office,
if listed with the Officers should be listed after the Principals of the Chapter.

While not Officers, if appointed the Royal Arch Representative and Installed Masters' Association Representative
must be included on the Summons.

The Summons should include as least two modes of contact for the Master, Treasurer, Secretary, Almoner,
Charity Steward, and Liaison Officer. In Chapters this applies equally to the Principals, Scribe E,
and other equivalents. This can be any two of personal address, phone number (or mobile), or email address.
For the protection of individual privacy, it is recommended that home addresses are not printed on summons
except by the consent of the member concerned and as long as his phone number and email address are both listed.

## Wording of Agenda Items

Certain items of Agenda must be worded in a specific way, or include specific details, or else the business conducted
may be invalid. The following is non-exhaustive list.

### Elections [Rule 105(a)]

If a Lodge is using the simpler procedure laid down in Rule 105(a) Book of Constitutions, the wording must be as follows:

> {. highlight}
  To elect a Master for the ensuing year. As only one Brother has been nominated and no other Brother has indicated to
  the Secretary that he wishes to be considered, the Worshipful Master will declare elected Bro AB, provided that no
  member present shall call for a ballot.

This is the same for the election of Treasurer, or for the election of the Three Principals in a Royal Arch Chapter.

### Candidates for Initiation [Rule 164(b)]

When a ballot is to be held for a Candidate for Initiation, Rule 164 requires that the following information
must be included on the Summons:

1) Full Name
2) Age
3) Profession or occupation (or former if retired)
4) Home address
5) Business address
6) Name of Sponsor
7) Date of Proposal in Open Lodge

### Candidates for Exaltation [Regulation 60]

The same details as for Candidates for Initiation, with the addition of every Lodge of which he is or was a member,
together with the date on which he was raised.

### Candidates for Joining / Rejoining [Rule 164(b) / Regulation 60]

In the case of candidates for joining, or rejoining, the same details as for Initiation are required except for Age,
and the addition of every Lodge of which he is or was a member.

### Exclusions [Rule 181]

A Ballot under Rule 181 should be listed on the Summons only as "To Ballot for the exclusion of member(s) under Rule 181".
The name of member or members whom it is proposed to exclude **must not** be listed on the Summons.

If the Ballot is due to non-payment of Subscriptions, this must be included in the agenda item.

### Initiations [Rule 159] / Exaltations [Regulation 60]

When a candidate is to be initiated or exalted, the summons must include the date of the meeting at which he was
successfully balloted for.

### Subscriptions [Rule 145]

Notice of Motion must appear on the Summons of the meeting previous to when the Proposition will be made, in the form:

> {. quote}
  The Treasurer will give Notice of Motion that at the next Regular Meeting he will propose that the Lodge Subscriptions
  be increased/decreased etc.
