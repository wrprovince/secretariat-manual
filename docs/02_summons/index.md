## General

The Summons is the Meeting Notice given to all members for every meeting of every Lodge and Chapter and includes the agenda as well as other crucial details.

As Secretary / Scribe E, you are responsible for preparing and distributing the Summons. It is important that they are accurate and follow the rules, as this can impact the business of your Lodge / Chapter if not followed correctly.

{: .important }
The Summons for any meeting must be issued not less than **TEN DAYS** prior the meeting. This is not a target and the Provincial Office encourages Lodges and Chapters to issue Summonses as early as possible after their previous meeting.

When issued, the Summons must be sent all members and to any such other persons as the Province should from time to time direct.
They should additionally be sent to the Provincial Office at 'summonsA\#@wrprovince.com' (where '\#' is your Area number).

If the presence of the Provincial Grand Master or Deputy Provincial Grand Master (or Grand Superindentent / Deputy) is desired at any special meeting of the Lodge, initial contact should be via the Provincial Grand Secretary (or Provincial Grand Scribe E) with a minimum of twelve months notice.

It should also be noted that, by virtue of their Office, the Provincial Grand Master, his Deputy, and Assistants, can demand admission into any Lodge in the Province and therefore do not need 'invitations' to attend any meeting. The same applies to the Grand Superintendent, his Deputy and Co-Principals in the Royal Arch, but not to the Assistants to the Provincial Grand Principals.

The Provincial Grand Secretary / Provincial Grand Scribe E must be informed in advance if a Ruler from another Province is to visit a Lodge / Chapter in Yorkshire, West Riding.

## Abbreviations and Titles

A Brother is entitled to use 'Worshipful Brother' immediately after he has been installed as Master of a Lodge. A Companion is entitled to use 'Excellent Companion' immediately after being installed as Third Principal of a Chapter.

The correct abbreviation for an Acting Officer of Grand Lodge is for example 'SGD' for Senior Grand Deacon, or for Past Rank 'PSGD'.

The correct abbreviation for an acting Provincial Officer is 'Prov' (e.g. 'ProvSGW') and for a Past Provincial Officer 'PProvSGW'. It is the rule of Grand Lodge that 'P' only applies to 'past' and therefore the use of 'PP' (e.g. 'PPSGW') should not be used to avoid confusion with Grand Rank. Neither should spaces or full stops be used between any of the letters or abbreviations (i.e. 'PProvSGW' not 'PProv SGW' or 'P.Prov.S.G.W')

## Past Masters

On every Summons issued the names and Ranks of every Past Master that appears in the Grand Lodge Installation Return must be included, along with the Lodge of which he was Master (if not this Lodge).

## Lists of Officers

Where Officers are listed on the Summons they should be listed per the precedence defined in Rule 104(d) Book of Constitutions. The IPM is not an Officer, but may be named elsewhere on the Summons as such, or in the list of Officers either immediately after the Master or Junior Warden. Regulation 48 in the Royal Arch defines the precedence of Chapter Officers, and similarly the IPZ, while not an Office, if listed with the Officers should be listed after the Principals of the Chapter.

While not Officers, if appointed the Royal Arch Representative and Installed Masters' Association Representative must be included on the Summons.

The Summons should include as least two modes of contact for the Master, Treasurer, Secretary, Almoner, Charity Steward, and Lodge Liaison Officer. In Chapters this applies equally to the Principals, Scribe E, and other equivalents.

The Summons should include as least two modes of contact for the Master (or Principals), the Secretary (Scribe E) and Treasurer. This can be any two of personal address, phone number (or mobile), or email address. For the protection of individual privacy, it is recommended that home addresses are not printed on summons except by the consent of the member concerned and as long as his phone number and email address are both listed.

Contact details should also be listed for the Almoner and Charity Steward (if appointed).
